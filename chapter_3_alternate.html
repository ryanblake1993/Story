    Chapter 3 Alternate Ending
</h1>
<h2>
    No Distractions
</h2>
<hr>
Although One ending showed Dylan never really grew up and could not let go of his favourite childhood game.
This alternate ending shows a different route for Dylan. He never got attached to “Yu-Gi-Oh”.
With this major distraction not ever reaching Dylan he was now fully focused.

<h3>
Secondary school came and left so fast for Dylan. He was now eighteen years of age and already on his way to College.
He applied to study Science. Dylan being the brightest of his group of friends was the only one to attend college that year,
the rest followed later. He applied to study Chemistry, Maths and Science were his favourite subjects in school.
