    Chapter 3 Alternate Ending
</h1>
<h2>
    No Distractions
</h2>
<hr>
Although One ending showed Dylan never really grew up and could not let go of his favourite childhood game.
This alternate ending shows a different route for Dylan. He never got attached to “Yu-Gi-Oh”.
With this major distraction not ever reaching Dylan he was now fully focused.
