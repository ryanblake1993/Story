    Chapter 2

<h2>
    College
</h2>
<hr>
<h3>
    Secondary school came and left so fast for Dylan. He was now eighteen years of age and already on his way to College.
    He applied to study Science. Dylan being the brightest of his group of friends was the only one to attend college that year,
    the rest followed later. He applied to study Chemistry. Maths and Science were his favourite subjects in school. Angela his mother
    passed away that summer before college.
    Education was always most important to Angela. This is the reason Dylan believed he did so well in college.
    <br>
    No longer playing children’s card games or watching children’s television shows, Dylan passed down his prized collections of Lego
    and Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards to his young nephew Damian. Damian a short child for his age carried with him a sense of humour and personality
    that reminded Dylan of himself growing
    up. He would often make his way onto the street with his small pockets bulging with his cards ready to challenge other children.
    <br>
    Days at college were boring and long. After the death of his mother he decided to put all of his efforts into his education. One day while
    studying in his bedroom his nephew came in bursting with Joy. “I won, I won! Dylan I Won!” he had just secured a win at the original
    tournament Dylan attended
    when he was roughly his age. Dylan was so happy for Damian and both celebrated by watching countless re-runs of the Show on television.
