<h2>
    College
</h2>
<hr>
<h3>
    Secondary school came and left so fast for Dylan. He was now eighteen years of age and already on his way to College.
    He applied to study Science. Dylan being the brightest of his group of friends was the only one to attend college that year,
    the rest followed later. He applied to study Chemistry. Maths and Science were his favourite subjects in school. Angela his mother
    passed away that summer before college.
    Education was always most important to Angela. This is the reason Dylan believed he did so well in college.
    <br>
    No longer playing children’s card games or watching children’s television shows, Dylan passed down his prized collections of Lego
    and Yu-Gi-Oh! Cards to his young nephew Damian. Damian a short child for his age carried with him a sense of humour and personality
    that reminded Dylan of himself growing
    up. He would often make his way onto the street with his small pockets bulging with his cards ready to challenge other children.
    <br>
    Days at college were boring and long. After the death of his mother he decided to put all of his efforts into his education. One day while
    studying in his bedroom his nephew came in bursting with Joy. “I won, I won! Dylan I Won!” he had just secured a win at the original
    tournament Dylan attended
    when he was roughly his age. Dylan was so happy for Damian and both celebrated by watching countless re-runs of the Show on television.
    <br>
    Together they formed a plan. Since the summer had approached Dylan now had time to train Damian the way he trained himself when he was younger.
    Dylan still remembered how difficult it was for him to prepare for the event and decided to help Damian in his venture.
    <br>
    Dylan kicked his the corner of Damian’s mattress at a time too early for Damian to comprehend. He opened one eye and looked around the
    room disoriented. “ What time is it???” damian said. “It’s training time” said Dylan. “Now get up!”. Damian followed the noise coming from
    the living room. He recognised the music coming from behind the door. Dylan had already pushed all the furniture across the room clearing the
    floor of any
    obstructions. “C’mon, get your cards ready” said Dylan. Both boys stood side by side staring at the television practising their stances.
