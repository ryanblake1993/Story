    College

<h3>
    Secondary school came and left so fast for Dylan. He was now eighteen years of age and already on his way to College.
    He applied to study Science. Dylan being the brightest of his group of friends was the only one to attend college that year,
    the rest followed later. He applied to study Chemistry. Maths and Science were his favourite subjects in school. Angela his mother
    passed away that summer before college.
    Education was always most important to Angela. This is the reason Dylan believed he did so well in college.
