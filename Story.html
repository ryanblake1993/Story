    <h3>
        On a cool October night Twenty-Three years ago, a young boy was born into a family of five.
        A Mother, Father, two girls and a boy. Dylan was the youngest by ten years. If there was anything Dylan had it was Potential.
        Dylan had a small group of friends from his neighbourhood. They played football from sunrise to sunset! Dylan could have played for Ireland.
        Although he couldn’t get up at sunrise, he was too lazy. And spent most of his time sleeping in late. The group six of young boys travelled
        their city from a young age. Entering their local train station in the early mornings with an unknown destination. They would pick and
        choose their adventures by randomly selecting a destination by pointing on the train line map. It was often the beaches along the coastline
        during the summer. The beaches were littered with likeminded groups of young adolescents, all of whom ended up at this location using a
        similar selection apparatus. Although Dylan again was too lazy. And missed out on many of these opportunities.
        <br>
        The group had a close bond. Attending School together from a very young age. Dylan the brightest of the six always excelled
        in their education. Although he was very lazy. And missed a great deal of most lessons. When the summer came Dylan spent most of his time indoors.
        Dylan’s appearance, hobbies and humour made him the epitome of nerd. He qualified for this position in every aspect measurable. He stood slouching
        mostly and had slightly larger front teeth protruding through his ever present smile. He once entered a card duelling competition based on a children’s
        television show called ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’. The event was held in a local children’s Toy store where Dylan was awarded first prize. His slight whimper of joy almost
        didn’t make it out of his mouth. As his name was announced over Tannoy, he took the time to look around at his foes as he relished in there loss. He gathered
        his cards together from their positions on the vinyl graphic battleground. Quickly pushing them back into their custom coloured polypropylene sheets.
        He almost did not believe it himself. “This is it!” he thought to himself, “I’m a Yu-Gi-Oh Master Dueler!”.
        <br>
        After winning the Prestigious title of "Master Dueller", Dylan was awarded the rare 'shiny' card named "Exzodia". After this dylan was invited to yet another
        more advanced competition hosted in the 'Hilton Hotel'.
        After this dylan was invited to yet another
        more advanced competition hosted in the 'Hilton Hotel'. The month of May was training camp for Dylan. His daily regime included waking up after mid-day, and
        watching countless re-runs of Yu-Gi-Oh on Sky One, propped on the centre of his living room floor. Meticulously arranging his deck to be battle ready daily.
        He knew the arrangement of cards from back to front. His favourite card ‘The Dark Magician’ was his noble knight in battle. He would throw down the card in a
        confident swiping motion holding the card in place between his index and middle finger, his roar could move mountains and scare others who witnessed it.
        Starting at the pit of his abyss stomach, the roar would race up his vocal chords peppering his opponent with saliva, “Dark Magician! I choose you!”.
        Dylan had practiced his stance for his parents for countless days. He was ready now.
        <br>
        The car journey to the event was agonizing for Dylan. He lay his teeth on the rubber fixtures of the car window the whole journey there for he had left his
        Gameboy console tucked between the cushions of his living room sofa. Fear, excitement and glory all seemed to bond and amalgamate into a rock of emotions in
        his stomach. The letters, “HILT..”, raced across the window. He didn’t need to read the sign. He felt the presence of a glorious battle omnipresent
        in time about to unfold.
