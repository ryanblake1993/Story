<h2>
    Is he Back?
</h2>
<hr>
<h3>
    Fast-forward five years. It is 2011 and Dylan, now taller is seventeen years old. After winning the battle in the
    Hilton he was offered a trip to travel to America. A once in a lifetime opportunity to battle the greatest duellers there was.
    Although Dylan missed out. He was too lazy to fill out the application form.
    <br>
    Time has passed now. He no longer battles. Although the battle is alive inside. Walking through the corridors
    of school he listens, like a silent predator ready to pounce on the unsuspecting victim. “That’s Dylan! I heard he won
    master dueller years back!”, “no that can’t be him! He doesn’t like much to me”, the faces in the corridor whispered.
    He was always ready for a battle. Carrying his best deck in his rear pocket.
    <br>
    Battling was becoming more and more popular around school. Many faces would pass in the corridor eyes
    bloodshot, cheeks red. “Must be playing for keep’sies”, Dylan thought to himself.
    <br>
    Leaving Cert study season was approaching. Dylan should now be studying heavily in his subjects.
    Although he was far too lazy. . And played and online game called League of Legends constantly. He has become so laid back in his
    work that he was forced to drop a level down, Ordinary level in Maths. Dylan’s parents did not take this lightly. Education always came first
    in his household. For this Dylan’s PC privileges were taken away. The summer holidays came and went so quickly. The cold weather meant a lot
    of time was spent indoors. With his PC taken away, Dylan focused not on school work, but his favourite past time, battling.
