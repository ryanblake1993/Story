<h2>
    Is he Back?
</h2>
<hr>

<h3>
    Fast-forward five years. It is 2011 and Dylan, now taller is seventeen years old. After winning the battle in the
    Hilton he was offered a trip to travel to America. A once in a lifetime opportunity to battle the greatest duellers there was.
    Although Dylan missed out. He was too lazy to fill out the application form.
    <br>
    Time has passed now. He no longer battles. Although the battle is alive inside. Walking through the corridors
    of school he listens, like a silent predator ready to pounce on the unsuspecting victim. “That’s Dylan! I heard he won
    master dueller years back!”, “no that can’t be him! He doesn’t like much to me”, the faces in the corridor whispered.
    He was always ready for a battle. Carrying his best deck in his rear pocket.
