<h2>
    Is he Back?
</h2>
<hr>
<h3>
    Fast-forward five years. It is 2011 and Dylan, now taller is seventeen years old. After winning the battle in the
    Hilton he was offered a trip to travel to America. A once in a lifetime opportunity to battle the greatest duellers there was.
    Although Dylan missed out. He was too lazy to fill out the application form.
    <br>
    Time has passed now. He no longer battles. Although the battle is alive inside. Walking through the corridors
    of school he listens, like a silent predator ready to pounce on the unsuspecting victim. “That’s Dylan! I heard he won
    master dueller years back!”, “no that can’t be him! He doesn’t like much to me”, the faces in the corridor whispered.
    He was always ready for a battle. Carrying his best deck in his rear pocket.
    <br>
    Battling was becoming more and more popular around school. Many faces would pass in the corridor eyes
    bloodshot, cheeks red. “Must be playing for keep’sies”, Dylan thought to himself.
    <br>
    Leaving Cert study season was approaching. Dylan should now be studying heavily in his subjects.
    Although he was far too lazy. . And played and online game called League of Legends constantly. He has become so laid back in his
    work that he was forced to drop a level down, Ordinary level in Maths. Dylan’s parents did not take this lightly. Education always came first
    in his household. For this Dylan’s PC privileges were taken away. The summer holidays came and went so quickly. The cold weather meant a lot
    of time was spent indoors. With his PC taken away, Dylan focused not on school work, but his favourite past time, battling.
    <br>
    He would wake up at sunrise every morning and run down stairs wearing only his underwear. The cold floor sent shivers up his back. Two
    slices of toast, and tea. And stand in front of the living room floor while practising his battle stance. No one was ever awake at this time.
    The living room was his sanctum between the hours of five and eight in the mornings. He would jump channels constantly as one episode would reach
    an advertisement break. He would move back to the previous showing. One show was not enough. He was constantly watching two channels
    simultaneously, sometimes even three. All this time, energy and focus spent into playing Yu-Gi-Oh, could have put him ahead of his schoolwork and
    back into his original class. But he was too lazy.
    <br>
    Winter passed and the New year bells rang in 2012, It was now time to go back to school. More and more kids were seemingly interested in the game.
    Dylan didn’t want to seem interested or even show that he cared. He would sit back in the school lunch room and watch helpless students commit to
    a game and lose their cards but this wasn’t his fight. Dylan was walking back to class, the Bell sounded indicating that it was now time to return to class. On his way
    to class he stopped off at the toilets to watch his hands. The sound of young tears and sniffling stopped quickly as Dylan entered he toilet.
    The three stalls in front all appeared to
    be empty. He could see the lower half of the door displayed no feet. He carried on anyways. Turning the tap and dispensing the soap into his dominant hand. Another strange
    noise! He turned to the immediate location of the
    noise. It was coming from behind one of the doors. “Is there someone in there?” Dylan asked, “No!” the smaller boy responded. “Is that you Sean? It’s Dylan!”.
    The small boy exited the stall with red puffy eyes pointing to the ground. “Luke Dunne
    took my cards!’. “Why did you play in in the first place?” Dylan asked. “He didn’t seem that good Dylan honestly!’. “C’mon, well go get your cards back!” Dylan said.
    Both boys exited the bathroom and walked to the behind the school to an empty patch of grass where a small group of boys were circled shouting, jumping and jeering.
    “Luke! Give Sean back his cards will ye’, his mam will give out to him if he comes home without them”. “No! I won them fair, everyone here saw it. Not my fault he can’t play!”.
    The crowd looked back to Dylan, all eyes on him. Awaiting his comeback. ‘I’ll play you for them?’, Dylan shouted back. All felt silent as the crowd awaited Luke’s reply.
